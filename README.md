### How to perform static code analysis and style checks
Configuration for lintr is in `.lintr` file. Lints are treated as warnings, but we strive to be lint-free.

In RStudio, you can run lintr from the console as follows:

```R
> lintr::lint_package()
> library(roxygen2)
> library("devtools")
> devtools::document()
```

This package is free and open source software, licensed under GPL.
